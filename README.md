# Demos using the [Web Speech Javascript API](http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/speech-api/raw-file/tip/speechapi.html "Web Speech API") specification from [Speech API Community W3C Group](http://www.w3.org/community/speech-api/)

This specification defines a JavaScript API to enable web developers to incorporate speech recognition and synthesis into their web pages. It enables developers to use scripting to generate text-to-speech output and to use speech recognition as an input for forms, continuous dictation and control. The JavaScript API allows web pages to control activation and timing and to handle results and alternatives.
